            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>I was born on August 14, 2001 and was given the name Favour. My family consists of five (5) people, including my parents. I am the first of three (3) children, as well as the only female. I am from Ogun State, specifically Abeokuta. I attended Alaba Lawson Elementary School in Abeokuta for my elementary education, Victorrotti Private Secondary School for my junior school education, and Patterson Memorial Baptist Grammar School for my senior school education. I had always wanted to be a lawyer, but despite having a high jamb score and an excellent waec result, I was denied admission to the university of my choosing. I went to Bowen University to study international relations because I couldn't get into law school because I started late. I received a second-class higher diploma. Now I'm unemployed and trying to learn a skill in order to acquire a job that pays well.
